This lesson provides an introduction to HPC (high performance computing) aimed at new system
administrators who have no previous experience of administering and supporting HPC facilities.

> ## After completing this lesson you should:
> - Have an understanding of the motivation for the use of HPC by researchers
> - Have an understanding of how researchers typically access HPC facilities as part of their workflow
> - Be aware of different HPC architectures in use today and the history of HPC architecture development
> - Have a basic understanding of parallel computing and approaches used by HPC users along with an introduction
>   to parallel performance and scaling
> - Be aware of current and future trends in HPC system development
{: .objectives}

The lesson includes some practical work to give you an idea of how users typically use HPC systems.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> - You should have familiarity with using a command line shell and accessing remote facilities vis SSH, and the lesson text will at times request that you "open a shell window" or "login to a HPC system" with an assumption that you know what this means. The lessons will sometimes request that you use an in-terminal text editor to create or edit files in particular directories. It is assumed that you are able to edit text files on a remote HPC system using an in-terminal text editor such
as vi, emacs or nano.
