- Note: no discussion of management setup - this is a user perspective of HPC

## Building blocks of HPC

- Login nodes
- Compute nodes: processors (vector, multicore), memory (NUMA), GPU
- Storage: shared, parallel, local
- Interconnect and topology
- Note: levels of parallelism - on-CPU/GPU, on-node, multi-node

## Example HPC architectures

- Frontier
- Fugaku
- ARCHER2

## History of HPC systems

- Top500 trends over time: vector, multicore, commmoditisation
- Systems change quickly - software changes much more slowly
